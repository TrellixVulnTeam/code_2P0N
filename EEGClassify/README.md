# EEG_Classify
### Some attempts to classify EEG signals from the BCI competition 

Both LSTM and CNN achieve 100% accuracy on the test set. 

These are the accuracies so far:

Support Vector Machine
: ~50% 

Long Short-Term Memory
: 100%

Convolutional Neural Networks
: 100% 

To do:
* Verify preliminary model with TensorFlow
* Find other datasets for motor imagery laterality to verify that the model works
* Use model with Live EEG
