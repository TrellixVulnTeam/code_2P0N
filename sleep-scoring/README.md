## Getting Started

 The code is not exactly the same, but with slight improvements.
Since we can not publish the training data due to privacy reasons we provide only the needed code to train your own model using your data. We also provide trained models and the code needed to apply it for edf files. 

### Prerequisites

You will need a GPU to train the network, but application of already trained model is possible using  a CPU. 



### Installing

After you have downloaded the folder with files you would need to download the external files needed to read edf. We used the library written by Brett Shoelson, it is available at https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31900-edfread. Put the mat files you get by following the link into edf2mat folder.

You also should install Matlab (we used 2018 version), Python 3, Keras and Tensorflow.


## Scoring your data


### Data conversion

At the moment you can work only with edf files. First you should convert them to .mat files which can be used by our network. You can use Matlab script raw2mat.m which is located in edf2mat folder.

Before you can convert your data you should open the raw2mat.m  script and set
following variables:
1) readPath = './../EEG_data/' % it is the path to the folder with edf files
2) writePath = '../mat/' % directory with the output data
3) labels for the EEG, EOG and EMG channels

Then you can run the script.

### Scoring

After you have converted your data you can either train your own network using script train.py
or use one of the networks we trained.

To use pretrained network you can run the script predict.py. You should set the variable n_channels.
It can be 1, 2 or 3. The network will use 1 EEG channels, 1 EEG + 2 EOG channels, or 1 EEG + 2 EOG + 1 EMG correspondingly.

If your recording is longer than 8 hours I suggest to use a script predict_split.py. It splits the recording into segments (by default 1000 epochs long) to make sure there would be enough memory.

The .mat files with the results will be stored in the folder ./score_sleep/pred/
After the recordings are scored you can plot the result by using the matlab script plot_res.m located in the folder score sleep. Script will product the hypnograms and store them in the folder ./score_sleep/plot.

### Training 

If you want to train your own network you should use the script train.py. 
In the script you should set variables data_dir and f_set.
data_dir is the directory with the data for training. f_set is the .mat file containing the list of files in training, validation and test sets. You can generate this file using one of the scripts in the tools folder: create_file_sets1.m or create_file_sets2.m. The difference between them is that the first one just splits the files randomly. The second one takes into account that different recordings can be recorded from the same person.

You also need to set n_channels in the same way as for scoring.
